        Semantic Table Interpretation, as defined by the widely accepted
        formalisation from the SemTab challenge, involves annotating relational
        tables with information from a Knowledge Graph (KG). This process
        includes associating each column in a table with one or more KG types,
        known as Column Type Annotation (CTA). Additionally, Cell Entity
        Annotation (CEA) is applied to annotate each cell in "entity columns"
        with a KG entity or mark it as NIL if it does not exist in the KG.
        Column Property Annotation (CPA) involves annotating pairs of columns
        with a binary KG property. The result of this annotation process is a
        table enriched with semantic information, which can introduce new
        elements to the KG.

        Discover the comprehensive world of Semantic Table Interpretation (STI)
        in this tutorial, which covers both theoretical and practical aspects,
        and trace the evolution of STI from heuristic-based methods to machine
        learning (ML) techniques and the latest large language model (LLM)
        innovations. By examining the unique characteristics, advantages, and
        limitations of each approach you will understand their optimal contexts
        of use.

        MammoTab is a unique dataset consisting of 1 million Wikipedia tables,
        extracted from over 20 million Wikipedia pages, and annotated using
        Wikidata. This dataset fills a gap in the current state-of-the-art
        resources, making it an excellent tool for testing and training Semantic
        Table Interpretation approaches. MammoTab is specifically designed to
        address several key challenges, including disambiguation, homonymy, and
        NIL-mentions, providing a comprehensive resource for advancing STI
        research and applications.
