        MammoTab, is a dataset composed of 1M Wikipedia tables extracted from
        over 20M Wikipedia pages and annotated through Wikidata. The lack of
        this kind of datasets in the stateof-the-art makes MammoTab a good
        resource for testing and training Semantic Table Interpretation
        approaches. The dataset has been designed to cover several key
        challenges, such as disambiguation, homonymy, and NIL-mentions
