      MammoTab, is a dataset composed of 1M Wikipedia tables extracted from over 20M Wikipedia pages and annotated through Wikidata.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lack of this kind of datasets in the stateof-the-art makes MammoTab a good resource for testing and training Semantic Table Interpretation approaches. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dataset has been designed to cover several key challenges, such as disambiguation, homonymy, and NIL-mentions
